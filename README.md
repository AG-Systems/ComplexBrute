**ComplexForce**

ComplexForce is a program that I had planned for a long time now. Expect many changes

Started working on it: Jan 27 2015

Project has never been finished as I lost motivation for this and I started working on other projects. I will come back and 
finish it one day. I will update it do not worry ;)

**Description**

The program will try to brute force using advanced algorithms. It will have many features and lots of options for cracking passwords.

**Platforms**

Windows

Simply download the .exe and run it.


OSX

Sorry, I do not work on OSX. Try using wine or some kind of vitural machine.


**Future plans**

In the future, I have many features that are planned to come. Here is the list

A full standalone .exe

A checkbox feature(Click the box how many it applies)

	check the options like #â€™s or with symbols
	
	Spaces
	
	Capitals
	
	Output to console,command line(like cmd) or to a .txt file
	
	# of Capitals
	
A timer to show how long it took you to crack

A test feature where you enter a password to see how long it would take to crack it and how strong the password is.

Maybe maybe it can be use be used for actual brute forcing on websites.

Custom skins

It will also have options for quick modes aka charset switchs.
	Charset switches like,

1-only numbers (10 characters)

2-only lowercase characters (26 characters)

3-only uppercase characters (26 characters)

4-numbers and lowercase characters (36 characters)

5-numbers and uppercase characters (36 characters)

6-uppercase and lowercase characters (52 characters)

7-numbers, uppercase and lowercase characters (62 characters)

You can turn off or on this mode.
